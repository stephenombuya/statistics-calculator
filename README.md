### **Overview**
The Statistics Calculator allows users to input a set of numbers and obtain statistical results instantly. Itâ€™s a useful tool for students, educators, and professionals who need quick and reliable statistical insights.


### **Features**
1. **Calculate Mean**: Find the average of a set of numbers.
2. **Calculate Mode**: Identify the number that appears most frequently.
3. **Calculate Median**: Determine the middle value of a sorted list.
4. **Calculate Range**: Compute the difference between the highest and lowest values.
5. **Calculate Variance**: Measure how far a set of numbers are spread out from their average.
6. **Calculate Standard Deviation**: Determine the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values.
7. **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for easy interaction.




### **Technologies**
- **HTML5**: For structuring the web application.
- **CSS3**: For styling and visual appeal.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the statistical calculations and logic.




### **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/stephenombuya/statistics-calculator/tree/main
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd statistics-calculator
```

3. Open the index.html file in a web browser to interact with the application.





### **Usage**
1. **Input Data**: Enter your data points in the provided input field. Separate multiple numbers with commas.
2. **Select Calculation**: Choose the statistical calculation you want to perform (Mean, Mode, Median, Range, Variance, or Standard Deviation).
3. **Calculate**: Click the "Calculate" button to compute the selected statistic.
4. **View Results**: The results will be displayed below the input field, showing the calculation along with the input data.





### **Code Structure**
- **index.html**: The main HTML file containing the structure and elements of the application.
- **styles.css**: The stylesheet for styling the user interface and enhancing the visual appeal.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for performing statistical calculations.




### **Sample Code**
Here's an example of the JavaScript function used to calculate the Mean:

```
const calculateMean = (numbers) => {
  const total = numbers.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
  return total / numbers.length;
}
```


### **Other Statistical Functions**
1. **Mode**: Implemented using a frequency map to count occurrences.
2. **Median**: Uses sorting to find the middle value.
3. **Range**: Calculates by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum.
4. **Variance and Standard Deviation**: Uses the mean to determine how much the values deviate.
